- When creating the app, do we have steps that set up your .env for you? So you can deploy smoothly...
- Sockets? Or does that layer on top of all the others as another variant / addition we can make?
- Make sure harper CLI is installed and configured
- Port to TypeScript? With type stripping?
- Publish pipeline with trusted publisher
  - create-harper
  - create-harperdb?
  - @harperfast/create?
