# Shared Template Files

This directory contains some shared files and configurations that are used across different templates. There is a
simple script to quickly copy the changes here into the other templates.

```bash
node applySharedTemplates.js
```

## Why?

The intention is to commit the changes here into each template. This increases the discoverability of the files when
browsing the repository directly. It also makes the templates easy to apply at runtime.

## How to Contribute

If you have changes that you want to apply to all templates, please make them here and run the script to apply them.
