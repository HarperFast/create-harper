This repository is intended for use alongside the Harper Learn ["Getting Started > Create Your First Application"](https://docs.harperdb.io/learn/getting-started/create-your-first-application) guide.

The `main` branch is the starting point for the guide.

The `completed` branch is the completed code example if you need to check your work.
